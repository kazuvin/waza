# Welcome to MDX Notes

This is a sample note written in MDX format. MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content, making it incredibly powerful for creating rich, interactive documentation.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly use JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, export metadata, and write JSX right in your markdown.

## Features

Here are some key features of this notes system:

- **Frontmatter Support**: Add metadata like title, date, description, and tags
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks with beautiful syntax highlighting
- **GitHub Flavored Markdown**: Tables, task lists, and more
- **Custom Components**: Use custom React components in your notes
- **Static Generation**: All notes are pre-rendered at build time for optimal performance

## Code Example

Here's an example of how to use code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```typescript
interface Note {
  slug: string;
  metadata: NoteMetadata;
  content: string;
}

export async function getNoteBySlug(slug: string): Promise<Note | null> {
  const fullPath = path.join(notesDirectory, `${slug}.mdx`);
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, "utf8");
  return { slug, metadata, content };
}
```
