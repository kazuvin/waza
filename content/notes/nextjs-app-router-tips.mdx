# Next.js App Router Tips and Tricks

The Next.js App Router (introduced in Next.js 13 and stable in 14+) brings powerful new features for building React applications. Here are some essential tips.

## Server Components by Default

In the App Router, all components are Server Components by default. This means:

- They run on the server
- They don't add to the client-side JavaScript bundle
- They can directly access backend resources

```tsx
// This is a Server Component by default
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
  return <div>{data.title}</div>;
}
```

## Client Components

To use client-side features like hooks, event listeners, or browser APIs, add the `"use client"` directive:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

## Static Generation with generateStaticParams

For dynamic routes, use `generateStaticParams` to pre-render pages at build time:

```tsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = await getPosts();
  return posts.map((post) => ({
    slug: post.slug,
  }));
}
```

## Metadata API

The new Metadata API makes it easy to add SEO-friendly metadata:

```tsx
export const metadata = {
  title: "My Page",
  description: "This is my page description",
};
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Server Components at the top**: Place Server Components as high in the tree as possible
2. **Use Client Components sparingly**: Only mark components as client components when needed
3. **Leverage streaming**: Use `loading.tsx` files for better UX
4. **Optimize images**: Always use the Next.js `Image` component

## Conclusion

The App Router is a powerful paradigm shift that enables better performance and developer experience. Start with Server Components and only add Client Components where interactivity is needed.
